    "### **1.1 What is CI/CD?**\n",
    "\n",
    "CI/CD refers to **automating the processes of integrating, testing, and\n",
    "deploying changes** in a software or data pipeline. It ensures: -\n",
    "**Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates code validation using **unit\n",
    "tests, integration tests, and schema validation**. - **Continuous\n",
    "Deployment (CD):** Ensures that **tested and validated code changes**\n",
    "are **automatically deployed to production** environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Key Benefits of CI/CD in Data Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Automated Testing**: Prevents errors from reaching production.\n",
    "-   **Faster Deployment Cycles**: Ensures frequent updates with minimal\n",
    "    manual intervention.\n",
    "-   **Better Collaboration**: Allows data engineers, analysts, and ML\n",
    "    teams to work efficiently.\n",
    "-   **Version Control**: Tracks all code changes for reproducibility and\n",
    "    debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Typical CI/CD Workflow in Data Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Source Control** – Store notebooks, SQL scripts, and\n",
    "    configurations in **GitHub, Azure Repos, or Bitbucket**.\n",
    "2.  **Build and Test** – Validate scripts using **unit tests, PySpark\n",
    "    tests, SQL linting, and schema enforcement**.\n",
    "3.  **Artifact Management** – Store JAR, wheel, or Python packages in\n",
    "    **Azure Artifacts, AWS CodeArtifact, or Nexus**.\n",
    "4.  **Deployment & Infrastructure as Code** – Automate cluster creation\n",
    "    and job execution using **Terraform, Databricks CLI, and GitHub\n",
