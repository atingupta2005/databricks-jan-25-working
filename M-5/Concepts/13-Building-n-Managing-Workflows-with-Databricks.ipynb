    "Databricks Workflows is an **orchestration and scheduling system** that automates **multi-step data processing, ETL pipelines, ML model training, and analytics tasks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Capabilities:**\n",
    "- **Orchestration of complex workflows**\n",
    "- **Job scheduling and automation**\n",

    "### **1.2 Core Components of Databricks Workflows**\n",
    "| Component        | Description |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Jobs**        | A collection of tasks that execute code, scripts, or queries. |\n",
    "| **Tasks**       | Individual steps in a workflow (e.g., data ingestion, transformation, ML model training). |\n",
    "| **Task Dependencies** | Defines execution order between tasks. |\n",
    "| **Triggers**    | Time-based or event-driven execution conditions. |\n",
    "| **Clusters**    | Compute resources assigned to a workflow. |\n",
    "| **Alerts & Monitoring** | Track job execution status and failures. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 How Databricks Workflows Work**\n",
    "1. **Define a job** – Create a workflow with multiple tasks.\n",
    "2. **Configure tasks** – Assign each task to run notebooks, scripts, SQL queries, or ML models.\n",
    "3. **Set dependencies** – Define execution order between tasks.\n",
    "4. **Schedule execution** – Use cron-based scheduling or event triggers.\n",
    "5. **Monitor & Optimize** – Track performance, handle failures, and fine-tune execution.\n",
