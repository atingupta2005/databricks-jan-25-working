    "## Key Components of Databricks Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Databricks Workspace**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Databricks workspace provides an interactive environment that brings\n",
    "together data engineering, data science, and analytics in a single\n",
    "interface. It offers: - **Collaborative Notebooks**: Support for\n",
    "multiple languages (Python, Scala, SQL, R) in shared notebooks. -\n",
    "**Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Version control,\n",
    "debugging, and interactive workflows. - **Asset Management**:\n",
    "Organization of jobs, libraries, tables, clusters, and permissions\n",
    "within a structured workspace. - **Access Management**: Fine-grained\n",
    "user permissions and role-based access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Clusters and Compute Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks clusters are managed cloud-based Spark clusters used for\n",
    "executing data workloads. Databricks provides two types of clusters: -\n",
    "**All-Purpose Clusters**: Shared, interactive clusters used for\n",
    "development and collaborative workflows. - **Job Clusters**: Ephemeral\n",
    "clusters that are created and terminated automatically to run specific\n",
    "jobs efficiently.\n",
    "\n",

    "based on load to optimize cost and performance. - **High availability**:\n",
    "Fault-tolerant cluster configurations ensure continuous operation. -\n",
    "**Optimized runtimes**: Databricks provides specialized runtime\n",
    "environments such as **Photon Engine** for faster query execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Data Management & Delta Lake**\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks integrates **Delta Lake**, an open-source storage layer that\n",
    "enhances data reliability, performance, and governance. Delta Lake\n",
    "provides: - **ACID Transactions**: Ensures data integrity and\n",
    "consistency. - **Schema Evolution & Enforcement**: Dynamically adjusts\n",
    "schemas while maintaining data quality. - **Time Travel**: Allows\n",
    "querying historical versions of data. - **Optimized Storage with\n",
    "Z-Ordering**: Improves query performance by physically organizing data\n",
    "files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Databricks Runtime (DBR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks provides a highly optimized runtime environment built on\n",
    "Spark, tailored for enterprise workloads. Key runtime versions\n",
    "include: - **Standard Runtime**: Optimized Apache Spark environment. -\n",
    "**ML Runtime**: Includes machine learning libraries like TensorFlow,\n",
    "PyTorch, and scikit-learn. - **GPU Runtime**: Optimized for deep\n",
    "learning workloads with GPU acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Security & Governance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise-scale deployments require stringent security measures.\n",
    "Databricks offers: - **Unity Catalog**: A centralized metadata\n",
    "management and access control system. - **Role-Based Access Control\n",
    "(RBAC)**: Granular permissions to control user access to clusters, jobs,\n",
    "and data assets. - **Encryption**: Data is encrypted in transit and at\n",
    "rest using cloud provider security measures. - **Compliance Standards**:\n",
    "Supports regulatory frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Workflow Orchestration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks provides built-in **Workflows** to automate and schedule\n",
    "tasks efficiently. Features include: - **Job Scheduling**: Execute\n",
    "notebooks, JARs, or Python scripts on predefined schedules. - **Data\n",
    "Pipelines**: Integration with Apache Airflow and Databricks Workflows\n",
    "for robust orchestration. - **CI/CD Integration**: Automate deployments\n",
    "using Databricks Repos with GitHub, Azure DevOps, and Jenkins. -\n",
    "**Event-Driven Execution**: Trigger jobs based on file uploads, table\n",
    "updates, or API calls.\n",
