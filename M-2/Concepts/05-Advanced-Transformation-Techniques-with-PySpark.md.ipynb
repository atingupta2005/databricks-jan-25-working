    "## **1. Core Transformation Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Lazy Evaluation & DAG Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark transformations are **lazy**, meaning that operations are **not\n",
    "executed immediately** but instead form a **Directed Acyclic Graph\n",
    "(DAG)**. This approach optimizes execution by minimizing unnecessary\n",
    "computations and reusing intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits of lazy evaluation: - **Optimized execution plans** that\n",
    "reduce computation time. - **Elimination of redundant transformations**\n",
    "before execution. - **Efficient memory usage** by only materializing\n",
    "results when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Narrow vs. Wide Transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Transformation Type**   | **Characteristics**                                   | **Example Operations**                |\n",
    "|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| **Narrow Transformation** | Operates on a single partition, no shuffling required | `.filter()`, `.map()`, `.select()`    |\n",
    "| **Wide Transformation**   | Requires data movement (shuffling) between partitions | `.groupBy()`, `.join()`, `.orderBy()` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these dependencies is crucial for optimizing PySpark\n",
    "performance and avoiding excessive shuffling that can degrade\n",
    "performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Data Preprocessing & Schema Evolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Handling Missing Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data pipelines often encounter missing values that must be addressed\n",
    "before further processing. Techniques include: - **Dropping missing\n",
    "values** to remove incomplete records. - **Filling null values** with\n",
    "computed defaults (mean, median, or placeholders). - **Using conditional\n",
    "imputation** to replace missing values based on related columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Managing Schema Evolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema evolution allows datasets to adapt to changes over time, such as\n",
    "adding new fields or modifying data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaches for handling schema evolution: - **Schema enforcement**:\n",
    "Prevents unexpected data type mismatches. - **Schema merging**: Allows\n",
    "dynamic updates when new columns are introduced. - **Backward\n",
    "compatibility**: Ensures old records remain usable as the schema\n",
    "evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques ensure **data integrity and compatibility across\n",
    "different data processing stages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Advanced Aggregations & Window Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Optimized Aggregations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregations summarize data by computing metrics such as sum, count, or\n",
    "average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices for efficient aggregations: - **Using `.groupBy()` with\n",
    "aggregation functions** to perform calculations efficiently. -\n",
    "**Reducing shuffling by partition-aware aggregations**. - **Utilizing\n",
    "`.pivot()` for dynamic reshaping of data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Window Functions for Ordered Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Window functions enable **running totals, ranking, and partition-based\n",
    "computations** without collapsing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common window function applications: - **Calculating running totals or\n",
    "moving averages**. - **Ranking customers based on transaction\n",
    "volume**. - **Detecting first and last occurrences in event data**.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **4. Efficient Joins & Broadcast Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 Choosing the Right Join Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Different join types impact performance based on dataset size and\n",
    "partitioning: - **Shuffle Hash Join**: Used when join keys are evenly\n",
    "distributed. - **Sort-Merge Join**: Best for large datasets that require\n",
    "sorting. - **Broadcast Join**: Efficient when one dataset is small\n",
    "enough to fit in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Optimizing Joins with Partitioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce shuffle overhead: - **Co-locate join keys in the same\n",
    "partition**. - **Use partition-aware joins** for frequently accessed\n",
    "datasets. - **Broadcast small datasets** to avoid unnecessary data\n",
    "movement.\n",
