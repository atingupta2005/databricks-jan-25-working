    "## **Lab 1: Setting Up Kafka Producer & Consumer**\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "- Configure Kafka topics for streaming data ingestion.\n",
    "- Produce and consume messages from Kafka.\n",
    "- Simulate a real-world transaction stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Start Kafka Broker & Create Topics**\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Start Zookeeper (if not running)\n",
    "zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties &\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start Kafka Broker\n",
    "kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties &\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new topic for transactions\n",
    "kafka-topics.sh --create --topic transactions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Produce Messages to Kafka Topic**\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Start a Kafka producer and send messages\n",
    "echo \"101,5000,2024-02-01,Loan\" | kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic transactions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Consume Messages from Kafka**\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# Start a Kafka consumer\n",
    "kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic transactions --from-beginning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
