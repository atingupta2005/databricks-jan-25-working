    "## **1. Delta Table Performance Optimizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Understanding Delta Table Performance Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Small file problem:** Frequent writes create small files,\n",
    "    degrading performance.\n",
    "-   **Slow query execution:** Large unoptimized tables result in long\n",
    "    query times.\n",
    "-   **High storage costs:** Retained data versions increase cloud\n",
    "    storage costs.\n",
    "-   **Inefficient partitioning:** Poor partition strategies lead to\n",
    "    unnecessary data scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Optimizing Query Performance with Z-Ordering**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-Ordering** improves data locality by sorting records within\n",
    "partitions based on frequently queried columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Applying Z-Ordering on a Delta Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "OPTIMIZE transactions ZORDER BY (customer_id);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Benefits:**\n",
    "    -   Reduces read time for queries filtering on `customer_id`.\n",
    "    -   Improves data clustering and scan efficiency.\n",
    "    -   Minimizes shuffle operations during queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Efficient Data Partitioning Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning **reduces the amount of data scanned during queries** by\n",
    "storing data in logically separated directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Creating a Partitioned Delta Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE transactions (\n",
    "    transaction_id STRING,\n",
    "    amount DOUBLE,\n",
    "    transaction_date DATE,\n",
    "    customer_id STRING\n",
    ") USING DELTA\n",
    "PARTITIONED BY (transaction_date);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices for Partitioning:** - Use **high-cardinality columns**\n",
    "(e.g., `transaction_date`) for partitioning. - Avoid over-partitioning\n",
    "on low-cardinality fields (e.g., `country_code`). - Combine\n",
    "**partitioning with Z-Ordering** for best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.4 Data Skipping for Faster Query Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta Lake leverages **data skipping** to scan only relevant portions of\n",
    "data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Enabling Data Skipping**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SET spark.databricks.delta.optimizeWrite.enabled = true;\n",
    "SET spark.databricks.delta.optimizeWrite.binSize = 128MB;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Helps avoid reading unnecessary files.\n",
    "-   Reduces query latency and improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Managing Constraints in Delta Lake**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Enforcing Primary Key Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta Lake **does not enforce primary keys natively**, but they can be\n",
    "simulated using constraints and merge operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Enforcing Primary Key with Merge Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "MERGE INTO target_table AS t\n",
    "USING source_table AS s\n",
    "ON t.transaction_id = s.transaction_id\n",
    "WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t.amount = s.amount\n",
    "WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Ensures unique transaction IDs.**\n",
    "-   **Prevents duplicate inserts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Using NOT NULL Constraints for Data Integrity**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE transactions ALTER COLUMN amount SET NOT NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Prevents null values** in critical columns.\n",
    "-   **Ensures data consistency across operations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Implementing Check Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check constraints enforce **business rules** by restricting invalid data\n",
    "entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Setting a Constraint on Transaction Amounts**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE transactions ADD CONSTRAINT valid_amount CHECK (amount > 0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Ensures transactions **always have a positive amount**.\n",
    "-   Prevents incorrect data from corrupting analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Data Compaction and Retention Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Optimizing Delta Tables with Compaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta tables accumulate small files due to streaming writes and frequent\n",
    "updates. **Compaction (OPTIMIZE)** combines small files into larger\n",
    "ones, improving read performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Running Optimize for Table Compaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "OPTIMIZE transactions;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Benefits:**\n",
    "    -   Reduces metadata overhead.\n",
    "    -   Improves query performance by minimizing file scans.\n",
    "    -   Enhances storage efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Configuring Data Retention Policies with VACUUM**\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta Lake **retains previous versions** for rollback and time travel.\n",
    "Old versions increase **storage costs** if not managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Removing Data Older Than 7 Days**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "VACUUM transactions RETAIN 168 HOURS;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Deletes files **older than 7 days (168 hours).**\n",
    "-   Prevents **excessive storage costs** while preserving rollback\n",
    "    capabilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **4. Advanced Indexing Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 Enabling Bloom Filters for Faster Querying**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom filters **accelerate lookups on non-partitioned columns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Adding a Bloom Filter Index on `customer_id`**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE transactions SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.bloomFilter.columns' = 'customer_id');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Improves query performance when filtering on `customer_id`.\n",
    "-   Reduces unnecessary file scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Using Delta Caching for Faster Query Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster\n",
    "retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Enabling Delta Cache**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "spark.conf.set(\"spark.databricks.io.cache.enabled\", \"true\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Speeds up read operations** by caching active dataset partitions.\n",
    "-   **Reduces I/O latency** in query execution.\n",
    "\n",
