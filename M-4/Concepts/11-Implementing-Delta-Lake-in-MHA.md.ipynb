    "## **2. Implementing Delta Lake in Multi-Hop Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Loading Data into the Bronze Layer (Raw Data Storage)**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n",
    "\n",
    "spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"BronzeLayerIngestion\").getOrCreate()\n",
    "\n",
    "bronze_df = spark.readStream.format(\"kafka\")\\\n",
    "    .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"localhost:9092\")\\\n",
    "    .option(\"subscribe\", \"transactions\")\\\n",
    "    .option(\"startingOffsets\", \"earliest\")\\\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Silver Layer** refines the raw data, performing **schema\n",
    "enforcement, deduplication, and incremental updates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Cleaning & Deduplicating Data in Silver Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from delta.tables import DeltaTable\n",
    "\n",
    "bronze_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, \"/mnt/delta/bronze_transactions\")\n",
    "\n",
    "silver_df = bronze_table.toDF().dropDuplicates([\"transaction_id\"]).filter(\"amount IS NOT NULL\")\n",
    "\n",
    "silver_df.write.format(\"delta\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"/mnt/delta/silver_transactions\")\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Gold Layer** is optimized for business intelligence and machine\n",
    "learning by **aggregating and structuring** the cleansed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Aggregating Sales Data in Gold Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "gold_df = spark.read.format(\"delta\").load(\"/mnt/delta/silver_transactions\")\\\n",
    "    .groupBy(\"customer_id\", \"transaction_date\")\\\n",
