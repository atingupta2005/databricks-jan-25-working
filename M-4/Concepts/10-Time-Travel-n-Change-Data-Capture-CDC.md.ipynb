    "\n",
    "In modern data architectures, managing historical data and tracking\n",
    "changes efficiently is essential for **data lineage, compliance,\n",
    "recovery, and real-time analytics**. **Time Travel** and **Change Data\n",
    "Capture (CDC)** are two critical techniques that enable organizations to\n",
    "**access historical data versions, audit changes, and process\n",
    "incremental updates** efficiently.\n",

    "## **1. Understanding Time Travel in Data Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 What is Time Travel?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Travel allows users to **query, restore, and compare historical\n",
    "versions** of a dataset. It provides: - **Data Versioning**: Each\n",
    "modification creates a new snapshot of the data. - **Auditing &\n",
    "Compliance**: Retrieve past states for regulatory requirements. -\n",
    "**Accidental Deletion Recovery**: Restore data if mistakenly deleted. -\n",
    "**Historical Trend Analysis**: Compare current and past trends for\n",
    "business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 How Time Travel Works in Delta Lake?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta Lake stores **all changes in the `_delta_log` transaction log**,\n",
    "maintaining a versioned history of the dataset. Users can retrieve past\n",
    "data using: - **Version-Based Queries:** Query data at a specific\n",
    "version. - **Timestamp-Based Queries:** Retrieve data at a particular\n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Querying Past Versions in Delta Lake**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using Version Number:**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM transactions_delta VERSION AS OF 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using Timestamp:**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM transactions_delta TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-01 00:00:00';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.4 Restoring Data from a Previous Version**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "RESTORE TABLE transactions_delta TO VERSION AS OF 3;\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### **2.1 What is CDC?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique for **tracking and processing\n",
