    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "In modern data architectures, managing historical data and tracking changes efficiently is essential for **data lineage, compliance, recovery, and real-time analytics**. **Time Travel** and **Change Data Capture (CDC)** are two critical techniques that enable organizations to **access historical data versions, audit changes, and process incremental updates** efficiently.\n",

    "### **1.1 What is Time Travel?**\n",
    "Time Travel allows users to **query, restore, and compare historical versions** of a dataset. It provides:\n",
    "- **Data Versioning**: Each modification creates a new snapshot of the data.\n",
    "- **Auditing & Compliance**: Retrieve past states for regulatory requirements.\n",
    "- **Accidental Deletion Recovery**: Restore data if mistakenly deleted.\n",
    "- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Compare current and past trends for business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 How Time Travel Works in Delta Lake?**\n",
    "Delta Lake stores **all changes in the `_delta_log` transaction log**, maintaining a versioned history of the dataset. Users can retrieve past data using:\n",
    "- **Version-Based Queries:** Query data at a specific version.\n",
    "- **Timestamp-Based Queries:** Retrieve data at a particular time.\n",
