    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Data security is a critical concern in **cloud environments** where organizations process and store vast amounts of sensitive data. Implementing **advanced encryption and network security** ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and protection from cyber threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a **detailed guide** on implementing **encryption and network security best practices** in cloud-based data platforms such as **Databricks and Azure**. It covers:\n",

    "## **1. Understanding Encryption**\n",
    "### **1.1 What is Encryption?**\n",
    "Encryption is the process of converting data into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access. It ensures that data remains **confidential and secure** even if intercepted.\n",

    "### **1.2 Types of Encryption**\n",
    "| Encryption Type | Description |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Symmetric Encryption** | Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES-256). |\n",
    "| **Asymmetric Encryption** | Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt (e.g., RSA, ECC). |\n",
    "| **Hashing** | Converts data into a fixed-length hash for integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256). |\n",
