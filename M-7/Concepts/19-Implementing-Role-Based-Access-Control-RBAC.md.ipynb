    "# **Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**) is a security model used to\n",
    "**restrict access to resources** based on predefined **user roles** and\n",
    "permissions. **RBAC ensures** that users only have the necessary\n",
    "permissions required for their job functions, reducing security risks\n",
    "and enhancing compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a **detailed guide** on implementing **RBAC in\n",
    "Databricks, Azure, and cloud-based environments**. It covers: -\n",

    "## **1. Understanding Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 What is RBAC?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Role-Based Access Control (**RBAC**) is a method of **restricting\n",
    "access** based on the roles assigned to **users, groups, and service\n",
    "accounts**. RBAC operates using: - **Roles**: Define access levels\n",
    "(e.g., Admin, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Viewer). - **Permissions**:\n",
    "Actions allowed for a role (e.g., Read, Write, Execute). -\n",
    "**Resources**: The objects being accessed (e.g., Clusters, Notebooks,\n",
    "Tables, Jobs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 RBAC vs. Traditional Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature                   | Traditional Access Control            | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Permission Assignment** | Assigned to users individually        | Assigned to predefined roles     |\n",
    "| **Scalability**           | Hard to scale for large organizations | Easily scalable across teams     |\n",
    "| **Security Management**   | More difficult to enforce consistency | Centralized access control       |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Key Benefits of RBAC**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Enhanced security**: Users only access what they need.\n",
    "-   **Simplified management**: Permissions are managed via roles, not\n",
    "    individual users.\n",
    "-   **Regulatory compliance**: Helps enforce security policies like\n",
    "    **GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2**.\n",
    "-   **Improved collaboration**: Provides controlled access to shared\n",
    "    resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

    "## **2. Implementing RBAC in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Databricks Access Control Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks provides **RBAC controls at multiple levels**: 1.\n",
    "**Workspace-Level Permissions**: Controls who can access notebooks,\n",
    "dashboards, and jobs. 2. **Cluster-Level Access**: Restricts usage of\n",
    "compute resources. 3. **Table-Level Permissions**: Defines access to\n",
    "Delta Lake tables using **Unity Catalog**. 4. **Job & Pipeline\n",
    "Permissions**: Determines who can execute workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Managing Workspace Permissions in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Assigning Role-Based Permissions in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles available in Databricks: - **Workspace Admin**: Full access,\n",
    "manages resources and security. - **Developer**: Creates and runs jobs\n",
    "but has limited admin controls. - **Data Analyst**: Can query and\n",
    "analyze data but cannot modify pipelines. - **Viewer**: Read-only access\n",
    "to dashboards and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Assigning a Role in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open **Databricks Workspace** → Navigate to **Admin Console**.\n",
    "2.  Go to **User Management** → Select a **user or group**.\n",
    "3.  Assign a role (**Admin, Developer, Analyst, or Viewer**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Users receive **permissions based on their\n",
    "assigned roles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. RBAC for Clusters and Jobs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Managing Cluster Permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster access is controlled to ensure **only authorized users can\n",
    "start, terminate, or modify clusters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Cluster Access Control | Permission                                   |\n",
    "|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Can Manage**         | Full cluster control                         |\n",
    "| **Can Attach To**      | Run jobs on the cluster but cannot modify it |\n",
    "| **No Permissions**     | Cannot use the cluster                       |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Assigning Cluster Permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Assign cluster-level access to a user\n",
    "databricks_clusters_permissions {\n",
    "  cluster_id = \"1234-56789-abcde\"\n",
    "  access_control_list = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      user_name = \"data_engineer@databricks.com\"\n",
    "      permission_level = \"CAN_MANAGE\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - **Only designated users can modify or attach to\n",
    "a Databricks cluster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Managing Job Permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks **Job Permissions** control who can create, edit, or execute\n",
    "jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Job Permission | Allowed Actions                           |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Can Manage** | Modify, delete, run, and manage schedules |\n",
    "| **Can Edit**   | Update configurations but cannot delete   |\n",
    "| **Can Run**    | Execute jobs but cannot edit or delete    |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Assigning Job Permissions via CLI**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "databricks jobs permissions add --job-id 9876 --access-level CAN_RUN --principal user@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - **Users can only perform actions based on\n",
    "assigned permissions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. RBAC for Data Access (Unity Catalog)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 Enforcing Table-Level Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks **Unity Catalog** provides **fine-grained access control**\n",
    "for Delta Lake tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Granting Table Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "GRANT SELECT ON TABLE financial_data TO user@example.com;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Revoking Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE financial_data FROM user@example.com;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Users can **only query tables they have access\n",
    "to**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Configuring Access Control Policies for Unity Catalog**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Limits data visibility based on user\n",
    "    attributes.\n",
    "-   **Column-Level Security (CLS)**: Restricts access to sensitive\n",
    "    columns (e.g., SSN, Credit Card Info).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Restricting Access to Sensitive Data Columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customer_info MASKING POLICY mask_ssn ON (ssn) TO role restricted_access;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
