    "### **1.1 What is Encryption?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption is the process of converting data into an unreadable format\n",
    "to prevent unauthorized access. It ensures that data remains\n",
    "**confidential and secure** even if intercepted.\n",

    "| **Hashing**               | Converts data into a fixed-length hash for integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256). |\n",

    "### **2.1 Encrypting Data at Rest**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data at rest refers to **stored data** in databases, file storage, or\n",
    "backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Enable Encryption in Azure Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Azure encrypts all data **by default using AES-256**.\n",
    "-   Use **customer-managed keys (CMK)** in **Azure Key Vault** for\n",
    "    enhanced security.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "az storage account update \\\n",
    "    --name mydatastore \\\n",
    "    --resource-group mygroup \\\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Encrypting Data in Transit**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in transit refers to **data moving between systems** over a\n",
    "network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Enforce TLS Encryption in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
