    "# **Enabling Data Lineage and Auditing with Unity Catalog - Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "In modern data platforms, **data lineage and auditing** are critical for ensuring **data governance, security, and compliance**. Unity Catalog in **Databricks** provides **built-in data lineage tracking** and **auditing capabilities**, enabling organizations to:\n",
    "- **Track data flow** across tables, views, and downstream applications.\n",
    "- **Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements** (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).\n",
    "- **Monitor access patterns** and detect unauthorized activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a **detailed guide** on enabling **data lineage and auditing using Unity Catalog**. It covers:\n",
    "- **Understanding data lineage and its importance**.\n",
    "- **Configuring Unity Catalog for data lineage tracking**.\n",
    "- **Implementing data auditing to monitor access and modifications**.\n",
    "- **Best practices for governance, security, and compliance**.\n",

    "## **1. Understanding Data Lineage and Auditing**\n",
    "### **1.1 What is Data Lineage?**\n",
    "**Data lineage** refers to the ability to track the **origins, transformations, and movement** of data across systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Why is Data Lineage Important?**\n",
    "- **Data Governance**: Helps organizations understand how data is created, transformed, and consumed.\n",
    "- **Impact Analysis**: Identifies dependencies and downstream effects of changes.\n",
    "- **Debugging & Troubleshooting**: Identifies errors and inconsistencies in data pipelines.\n",
    "- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures transparency and accountability for data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 What is Data Auditing?**\n",
    "Data auditing refers to the **tracking and recording of data access, modifications, and security events** to:\n",
    "- **Ensure compliance with data policies**.\n",
    "- **Identify unauthorized access** or suspicious activities.\n",
    "- **Monitor data modifications and lineage changes**.\n",

    "## **2. Enabling Data Lineage in Unity Catalog**\n",
    "### **2.1 Data Lineage Architecture in Unity Catalog**\n",
    "Unity Catalog automatically **captures data lineage** at multiple levels:\n",
    "- **Table-Level Lineage**: Tracks which queries created or modified a table.\n",
    "- **Column-Level Lineage**: Identifies transformations applied to specific columns.\n",
    "- **Notebook & Job Lineage**: Associates data changes with specific jobs and users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Enabling Data Lineage Tracking**\n",
    "Unity Catalog **automatically records** lineage when a table is registered within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Enable Unity Catalog in Databricks**\n",
    "1. Open **Databricks Admin Console** → Navigate to **Unity Catalog**.\n",
    "2. Enable **lineage tracking** for all tables and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: View Lineage in Databricks UI**\n",
    "1. Open the **Unity Catalog**.\n",
    "2. Select a **database** → Click on a **table**.\n",
    "3. Navigate to the **Lineage Tab** to view data flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:**\n",
    "- Unity Catalog displays **table-level and column-level lineage**.\n",
