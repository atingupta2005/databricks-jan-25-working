    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern data platforms, **data lineage and auditing** are critical for\n",
    "ensuring **data governance, security, and compliance**. Unity Catalog in\n",
    "**Databricks** provides **built-in data lineage tracking** and\n",
    "**auditing capabilities**, enabling organizations to: - **Track data\n",
    "flow** across tables, views, and downstream applications. - **Ensure\n",
    "compliance with regulatory requirements** (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.). -\n",
    "**Monitor access patterns** and detect unauthorized activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a **detailed guide** on enabling **data lineage\n",
    "and auditing using Unity Catalog**. It covers: - **Understanding data\n",
    "lineage and its importance**. - **Configuring Unity Catalog for data\n",
    "lineage tracking**. - **Implementing data auditing to monitor access and\n",
    "modifications**. - **Best practices for governance, security, and\n",

    "## **1. Understanding Data Lineage and Auditing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 What is Data Lineage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data lineage** refers to the ability to track the **origins,\n",
    "transformations, and movement** of data across systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Why is Data Lineage Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Data Governance**: Helps organizations understand how data is\n",
    "    created, transformed, and consumed.\n",
    "-   **Impact Analysis**: Identifies dependencies and downstream effects\n",
    "    of changes.\n",
    "-   **Debugging & Troubleshooting**: Identifies errors and\n",
    "    inconsistencies in data pipelines.\n",
    "-   **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures transparency and accountability\n",
    "    for data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 What is Data Auditing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data auditing refers to the **tracking and recording of data access,\n",
    "modifications, and security events** to: - **Ensure compliance with data\n",
    "policies**. - **Identify unauthorized access** or suspicious\n",
    "activities. - **Monitor data modifications and lineage changes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Enabling Data Lineage in Unity Catalog**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Data Lineage Architecture in Unity Catalog**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unity Catalog automatically **captures data lineage** at multiple\n",
    "levels: - **Table-Level Lineage**: Tracks which queries created or\n",
    "modified a table. - **Column-Level Lineage**: Identifies transformations\n",
    "applied to specific columns. - **Notebook & Job Lineage**: Associates\n",
    "data changes with specific jobs and users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Enabling Data Lineage Tracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unity Catalog **automatically records** lineage when a table is\n",
    "registered within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Enable Unity Catalog in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open **Databricks Admin Console** → Navigate to **Unity Catalog**.\n",
    "2.  Enable **lineage tracking** for all tables and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: View Lineage in Databricks UI**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open the **Unity Catalog**.\n",
    "2.  Select a **database** → Click on a **table**.\n",
    "3.  Navigate to the **Lineage Tab** to view data flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Unity Catalog displays **table-level and\n",
    "column-level lineage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Querying Data Lineage Using SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM system.information_schema.table_lineage WHERE table_name = 'sales_data';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Implementing Data Auditing in Unity Catalog**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Enabling Audit Logging in Unity Catalog**\n",
    "\n",
    "Audit logs **track and store** key security and compliance events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Configure Audit Logs for Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Go to **Azure Monitor → Diagnostic Settings**.\n",
    "2.  Enable **Databricks Audit Logs**.\n",
    "3.  Choose **Storage Account or Event Hub** to store logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Monitoring Data Access Logs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use SQL queries to monitor **who accessed which tables and when**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Checking Data Access Logs**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT user_name, action, table_name, event_time\n",
    "FROM system.information_schema.audit_logs\n",
    "WHERE action IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE')\n",
    "ORDER BY event_time DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - The query returns a **history of all data access\n",
    "events**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-   **Enable automatic lineage tracking** for all datasets.\n",
    "-   **Use column-level lineage** to track specific transformations.\n",
    "-   **Integrate lineage with business metadata** for enhanced\n",
    "    governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Best Practices for Data Auditing**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Regularly review audit logs** for unusual data access patterns.\n",
    "-   **Set up alerts** for unauthorized data access attempts.\n",
    "-   **Retain audit logs** as per compliance policies (e.g., retain logs\n",
    "    for 1 year).\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling **Data Lineage and Auditing with Unity Catalog** helps\n",
    "organizations ensure **data transparency, security, and compliance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways: - **Data Lineage** tracks the full lifecycle of data from\n",
    "ingestion to consumption. - **Unity Catalog enables automatic lineage\n",
    "tracking** for tables, columns, and notebooks. - **Audit logs provide\n",
    "visibility into data access and modifications**. - **Implementing best\n",
