    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Enable Storage Account Encryption**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az storage account update \\\n",
    "    --name mydatastore \\\n",
    "    --resource-group mygroup \\\n",
    "    --encryption-services blob,file \\\n",
    "    --encryption-key-source Microsoft.Keyvault\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Verify Encryption Settings**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az storage account show --name mydatastore --query \"encryption\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:**\n",
    "- The storage account is **encrypted using customer-managed keys (CMK)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 2: Encrypting Data in Transit**\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "- Ensure **secure data transmission** using **TLS encryption**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Configure Databricks to Use Encrypted JDBC Connections**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "spark.read.format(\"jdbc\").option(\"url\", \"jdbc:sqlserver://server.database.windows.net:1433;encrypt=true\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Enforce TLS 1.2 for Azure Application Gateway**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az network application-gateway ssl-policy set \\\n",
    "    --gateway-name myGateway \\\n",
    "    --resource-group mygroup \\\n",
    "    --policy-type Predefined \\\n",
    "    --policy-name AppGwSslPolicy2022\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:**\n",
    "- **All data transmissions are encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 3: Securing Network Access to Databricks**\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "- Restrict **Databricks workspace access** to specific IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Configure IP Whitelisting for Databricks**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az network nsg rule create \\\n",
    "    --resource-group mygroup \\\n",
    "    --nsg-name myNSG \\\n",
    "    --name AllowSpecificIP \\\n",

    "    --direction Inbound \\\n",
    "    --source-address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16 \\\n",
    "    --destination-port-ranges 443 \\\n",
    "    --access Allow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Verify Network Restrictions**\n",
    "- Attempt to **connect to Databricks from an unauthorized IP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:**\n",
    "- **Unauthorized IPs are blocked** from accessing the Databricks workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 4: Implementing Private Link for Databricks**\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "- Ensure **Databricks traffic remains within a private network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Deploy Databricks Workspace with Private Link**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az databricks workspace create \\\n",
    "    --name private-databricks \\\n",
    "    --resource-group mygroup \\\n",
    "    --location eastus \\\n",
    "    --enable-no-public-ip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Verify Private Link Configuration**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az network private-link-resource list --name private-databricks --resource-group mygroup\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Lab 5: Managing Encryption Keys and Secrets**\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "- Securely **store and retrieve encryption keys and credentials**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Store Secrets in Databricks**\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "spark.conf.set(\"fs.azure.account.key.mydatastore.blob.core.windows.net\", dbutils.secrets.get(scope=\"mysecrets\", key=\"storage-key\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Validate Secure Access**\n",
    "- Attempt to **access secrets without proper permissions**.\n",
