    "# **Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Hands-on Labs**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on lab document provides **detailed, step-by-step exercises**\n",
    "to implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Databricks, Azure,\n",
    "and cloud-based environments**. These labs will cover: - **Configuring\n",
    "workspace-level access control**. - **Managing cluster and job\n",
    "permissions**. - **Implementing RBAC for Unity Catalog and Delta\n",
    "Lake**. - **Monitoring and auditing role-based access**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each lab includes **real-world examples**, **step-by-step\n",
    "instructions**, and **sample configurations** to ensure **secure access\n",
    "management**.\n",

    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 1: Configuring Workspace-Level Permissions in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Assign user roles to restrict or grant access to **notebooks,\n",
    "    dashboards, and workspace assets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Assign a Role in Databricks Workspace**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open **Databricks Workspace** → Navigate to **Admin Console**.\n",
    "2.  Select **User Management**.\n",
    "3.  Choose a user or group and assign a **role**:\n",
    "    -   **Admin**: Full control over the workspace.\n",
    "    -   **Developer**: Can create and run notebooks/jobs.\n",
    "    -   **Viewer**: Read-only access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Verify Role Assignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Log in as the assigned user and verify that actions are restricted\n",
    "    based on the assigned role.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Users can only perform actions permitted by\n",
    "their assigned roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 2: Managing Cluster-Level Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Configure **access control for clusters** to restrict who can\n",
    "    attach, manage, or terminate clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Assign Cluster Permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Assign cluster-level access to a user\n",
    "databricks_clusters_permissions {\n",
    "  cluster_id = \"1234-56789-abcde\"\n",
    "  access_control_list = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      user_name = \"data_engineer@databricks.com\"\n",
    "      permission_level = \"CAN_MANAGE\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Verify Cluster Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Attempt to start/terminate a cluster as an unauthorized user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Only authorized users can manage the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 3: Implementing RBAC for Jobs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Assign **permissions for Databricks jobs** to control who can\n",
    "    create, run, or manage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Assign Job Permissions Using CLI**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "databricks jobs permissions add --job-id 9876 --access-level CAN_RUN --principal user@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Validate Job Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Log in as the assigned user and attempt to **run, modify, or\n",
    "    delete** the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Users can only perform job actions that match\n",
    "their permission level.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 4: Securing Table Access Using Unity Catalog**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Configure **fine-grained table access** for Delta Lake using Unity\n",
    "    Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Grant Table Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "GRANT SELECT ON TABLE financial_data TO user@example.com;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Verify Restricted Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM financial_data;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Try querying the table as a **user without SELECT permissions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Unauthorized users should be blocked from\n",
    "accessing the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 5: Enforcing Column-Level and Row-Level Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Mask sensitive data and enforce **row-level restrictions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Apply Column Masking for Sensitive Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customer_info MASKING POLICY mask_ssn ON (ssn) TO role restricted_access;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Restrict Row Access Based on User Role**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sql\n",
    "CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY region_policy\n",
    "  ON customer_info\n",
    "  FOR ROWS WHERE region = CURRENT_USER_REGION();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Sensitive columns are **masked** for\n",
    "unauthorized users. - Users only see **data relevant to their role**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Lab 6: Auditing and Monitoring RBAC Changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Monitor role-based access changes using Databricks audit logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Enable Databricks Audit Logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Navigate to **Azure Monitor** → Select **Databricks Workspace**.\n",
    "2.  Enable **Audit Logs** and configure **event tracking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Review Access Logs**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Query **audit logs** to track unauthorized access attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** - Logs capture **user access events** and\n",
    "**security policy changes**.\n",
