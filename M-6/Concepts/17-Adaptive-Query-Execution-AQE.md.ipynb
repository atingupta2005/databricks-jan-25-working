    "# **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) - Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive Query Execution (**AQE**) is a powerful feature in Apache Spark\n",
    "that dynamically optimizes query plans **at runtime** based on the\n",
    "actual data statistics. Unlike traditional static query optimization,\n",
    "AQE **adjusts execution strategies** based on real-time execution\n",
    "metrics, leading to **better performance, reduced shuffle overhead, and\n",
    "optimized resource utilization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a **detailed guide** on understanding and\n",
    "implementing **AQE in Spark** for efficient query execution in\n",
    "**Databricks and cloud-based environments**. It covers: - **Fundamentals\n",
    "of AQE and how it differs from static query planning** - **Key AQE\n",
    "optimization techniques (Shuffle optimizations, Join strategy selection,\n",
    "Skew handling)** - **Use cases and best practices for performance\n",
    "improvement** - **Configuration and tuning strategies in Databricks**\n",

    "## **1. Understanding Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 What is AQE?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive Query Execution (**AQE**) is a runtime optimization technique\n",
    "that dynamically adjusts query execution plans based on **actual query\n",
    "runtime statistics**. It helps overcome inefficiencies in static query\n",
    "plans, making Spark **more flexible and efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 How AQE Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Query Execution Starts**: The query plan is initially optimized\n",
    "    based on estimated statistics.\n",
    "2.  **Runtime Metrics Collected**: Spark **collects real execution\n",
    "    statistics** (e.g., partition sizes, data skew, shuffle metrics).\n",
    "3.  **Execution Plan Adjustments**: The optimizer **modifies the\n",
    "    execution plan dynamically** based on collected statistics.\n",
    "4.  **Optimized Query Execution**: Spark executes the modified,\n",
    "    **optimized query plan**, leading to improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 AQE vs.Â Traditional Query Optimization**\n",

    "## **2. Key AQE Optimization Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Dynamic Coalescing of Shuffle Partitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark **dynamically adjusts shuffle partitions** to optimize performance\n",
    "and reduce resource wastage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Enabling Dynamic Shuffle Partitioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n",
    "\n",
    "spark = SparkSession.builder \\\n",
    "    .appName(\"AQE Example\") \\\n",
    "    .config(\"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\", \"true\") \\\n",
    "    .config(\"spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled\", \"true\") \\\n",
    "    .getOrCreate()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:** - Reduces unnecessary shuffle partitions for small\n",
    "datasets. - Prevents large partitions from being split inefficiently. -\n",
    "Optimizes **join and aggregation performance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Dynamic Join Strategy Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "AQE can switch between **broadcast joins, shuffle joins, and sort-merge\n",
    "joins** based on real-time metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Allowing Dynamic Join Rewriting**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.adaptive.join.enabled\", \"true\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:** - If **one dataset is small enough**, Spark converts a\n",
    "**shuffle join** into a **broadcast join**, reducing shuffle overhead. -\n",
    "If **data sizes change**, Spark can dynamically **switch join\n",
    "strategies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Skew Handling in AQE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data skew **causes performance bottlenecks** when some partitions are\n",
    "much larger than others. AQE automatically **splits skewed partitions\n",
    "into smaller sub-partitions** for better load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Enabling Skew Join Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled\", \"true\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:** - **Prevents a single task from slowing down an entire\n",
    "job**. - **Evenly distributes data across cluster nodes**. - **Reduces\n",
    "execution time for skewed queries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Configuring and Tuning AQE in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Enabling AQE in Databricks**\n",
    "\n",
    "AQE is enabled **by default** in Databricks Runtime **7.3 and later**.\n",
    "However, it can be explicitly configured:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\", \"true\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Key AQE Configuration Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Configuration Parameter                         | Default Value | Description                                     |\n",
    "|----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled`                    | `true`        | Enables Adaptive Query Execution                |\n",
    "| `spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled` | `true`        | Dynamically optimizes shuffle partitions        |\n",
    "| `spark.sql.adaptive.join.enabled`               | `true`        | Enables dynamic join strategy selection         |\n",
    "| `spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled`           | `true`        | Splits skewed partitions for better performance |\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
