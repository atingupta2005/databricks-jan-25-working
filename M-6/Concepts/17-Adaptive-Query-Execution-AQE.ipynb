    "# **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) - Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Adaptive Query Execution (**AQE**) is a powerful feature in Apache Spark that dynamically optimizes query plans **at runtime** based on the actual data statistics. Unlike traditional static query optimization, AQE **adjusts execution strategies** based on real-time execution metrics, leading to **better performance, reduced shuffle overhead, and optimized resource utilization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a **detailed guide** on understanding and implementing **AQE in Spark** for efficient query execution in **Databricks and cloud-based environments**. It covers:\n",
    "- **Fundamentals of AQE and how it differs from static query planning**\n",
    "- **Key AQE optimization techniques (Shuffle optimizations, Join strategy selection, Skew handling)**\n",

    "### **1.1 What is AQE?**\n",
    "Adaptive Query Execution (**AQE**) is a runtime optimization technique that dynamically adjusts query execution plans based on **actual query runtime statistics**. It helps overcome inefficiencies in static query plans, making Spark **more flexible and efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 How AQE Works**\n",
    "1. **Query Execution Starts**: The query plan is initially optimized based on estimated statistics.\n",
    "2. **Runtime Metrics Collected**: Spark **collects real execution statistics** (e.g., partition sizes, data skew, shuffle metrics).\n",
    "3. **Execution Plan Adjustments**: The optimizer **modifies the execution plan dynamically** based on collected statistics.\n",
    "4. **Optimized Query Execution**: Spark executes the modified, **optimized query plan**, leading to improved performance.\n",
