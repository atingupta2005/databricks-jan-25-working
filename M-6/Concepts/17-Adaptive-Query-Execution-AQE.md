# **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) - Concepts**

## **Introduction**
Adaptive Query Execution (**AQE**) is a powerful feature in Apache Spark that dynamically optimizes query plans **at runtime** based on the actual data statistics. Unlike traditional static query optimization, AQE **adjusts execution strategies** based on real-time execution metrics, leading to **better performance, reduced shuffle overhead, and optimized resource utilization**.

This document provides a **detailed guide** on understanding and implementing **AQE in Spark** for efficient query execution in **Databricks and cloud-based environments**. It covers:
- **Fundamentals of AQE and how it differs from static query planning**
- **Key AQE optimization techniques (Shuffle optimizations, Join strategy selection, Skew handling)**
- **Use cases and best practices for performance improvement**
- **Configuration and tuning strategies in Databricks**

## **1. Understanding Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)**
### **1.1 What is AQE?**
Adaptive Query Execution (**AQE**) is a runtime optimization technique that dynamically adjusts query execution plans based on **actual query runtime statistics**. It helps overcome inefficiencies in static query plans, making Spark **more flexible and efficient**.

### **1.2 How AQE Works**
1. **Query Execution Starts**: The query plan is initially optimized based on estimated statistics.
2. **Runtime Metrics Collected**: Spark **collects real execution statistics** (e.g., partition sizes, data skew, shuffle metrics).
3. **Execution Plan Adjustments**: The optimizer **modifies the execution plan dynamically** based on collected statistics.
4. **Optimized Query Execution**: Spark executes the modified, **optimized query plan**, leading to improved performance.

### **1.3 AQE vs. Traditional Query Optimization**
| Feature            | Static Query Optimization | Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Optimization Timing** | Before Execution (Compile Time) | During Execution (Runtime) |
| **Data Awareness** | Uses estimated statistics | Uses actual runtime statistics |
| **Handling Skewed Data** | Fixed shuffle partitions | Dynamically coalesces partitions |
| **Join Strategy Selection** | Based on predefined heuristics | Adaptive join selection based on runtime metrics |

## **2. Key AQE Optimization Techniques**
### **2.1 Dynamic Coalescing of Shuffle Partitions**
Spark **dynamically adjusts shuffle partitions** to optimize performance and reduce resource wastage.

#### **Example: Enabling Dynamic Shuffle Partitioning**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("AQE Example") \
    .config("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true") \
    .config("spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled", "true") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces unnecessary shuffle partitions for small datasets.
- Prevents large partitions from being split inefficiently.
- Optimizes **join and aggregation performance**.

### **2.2 Dynamic Join Strategy Selection**
AQE can switch between **broadcast joins, shuffle joins, and sort-merge joins** based on real-time metrics.

#### **Example: Allowing Dynamic Join Rewriting**
```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.join.enabled", "true")
```

**How It Works:**
- If **one dataset is small enough**, Spark converts a **shuffle join** into a **broadcast join**, reducing shuffle overhead.
- If **data sizes change**, Spark can dynamically **switch join strategies**.

---

### **2.3 Skew Handling in AQE**
Data skew **causes performance bottlenecks** when some partitions are much larger than others. AQE automatically **splits skewed partitions into smaller sub-partitions** for better load balancing.

#### **Example: Enabling Skew Join Handling**
```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled", "true")
```

**Benefits:**
- **Prevents a single task from slowing down an entire job**.
- **Evenly distributes data across cluster nodes**.
- **Reduces execution time for skewed queries**.

---

## **3. Configuring and Tuning AQE in Databricks**
### **3.1 Enabling AQE in Databricks**
AQE is enabled **by default** in Databricks Runtime **7.3 and later**. However, it can be explicitly configured:
```python
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
```

### **3.2 Key AQE Configuration Parameters**
| Configuration Parameter | Default Value | Description |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled` | `true` | Enables Adaptive Query Execution |
| `spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled` | `true` | Dynamically optimizes shuffle partitions |
| `spark.sql.adaptive.join.enabled` | `true` | Enables dynamic join strategy selection |
| `spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled` | `true` | Splits skewed partitions for better performance |

## **4. Use Cases and Best Practices**
### **4.1 When to Use AQE**
- **Handling large datasets with varying partition sizes**.
- **Optimizing query performance in unpredictable workloads**.
- **Reducing shuffle overhead for expensive queries**.

### **4.2 Best Practices for AQE Optimization**
- **Enable AQE for large-scale transformations** to dynamically adjust plans.
- **Use broadcast joins wherever possible** for smaller datasets.
- **Regularly monitor query execution plans** to fine-tune AQE settings.
- **Combine AQE with Delta Lake** for even better performance optimizations.
